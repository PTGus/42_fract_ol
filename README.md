## Fractol
Fractol is a program that visually generates and explores fractals, such as the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. Using complex mathematical formulas and iterative calculations, it creates stunning, infinitely detailed patterns. Built for efficiency and interactivity, the program allows users to zoom, pan, and adjust parameters to explore the beauty of fractals dynamically.

This project was developed as part of my 42 School curriculum to deepen my understanding of programming concepts.

## Setup
To run this program, clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:PTGus/42_fract_ol.git
```
Navigate to the created directory and compile the program using the Makefile:
```
cd 42_fract_ol  
make
```
Once compiled, run the program:
```
./fractol
```
A prompt will appear with instructions on how to use the program.
